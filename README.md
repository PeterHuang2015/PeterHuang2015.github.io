# Peter's Blog

This is my blog, hosted on Github, uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), forked from Andrej Karpathy's repository(thx Andrej) and modified. Visit [talkwithme.cn](http://talkwithme.cn) to check it and feel free to fork your own copy.

### Overview
In this blog, I will share note on online courses and topics on my daily work. Also I keep modifying the blog from time to time to make it looks better.

### Foreword

Symbols let us express complex things in concise way. But without enough context information, mathematics is poisonous rather than being helpful for our reading and learning experience, serves as a trick to make the paper looks meaty.

As math troubles most of us when we met for the first time, genius guys could help by creating sites like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com/), [AOPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/), writing books like [Calculus Lifesaver](http://www.openculture.com/2011/11/calculus_lifesaver_a_free_online_course.html), providing courses like [LHTL](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). We need to practice like learning a language to really embrace it rather than let it being the jargon for professionals.

### Number for everything
> To extend the power of human mind by joining us in a union.

The name of google came from the word __Googol__ which stands for a fairly big number($$10^{100}$$), and the roadmap of the company is interesting: turn everything to numbers->do computation->automate repetitive work->iterate.

It doesn't matter what the world is, atoms for real world but numbers for human mind, which could link all human minds as a whole entity to do things that could not be done solely by anyone of us.

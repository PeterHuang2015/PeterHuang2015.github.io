### Start from installation
Pretty funny, the journey to explore torch start from installing pytorch from source code. It's easy to do following the instructions given on Pytorch's github [README](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/).
So it is to build tensorflow from source code following the [official guideline](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source). Both could be pretty time consuming as lots of stuff got included, and lot of details hidden in the auto compiling process, its better to get the general idea of how these frameworks can do for us before trying to understand each line in the source code.
